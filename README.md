# Personal Portfolio

This is the official repository for my personal portfolio, built from scratch to showcase my skills, projects, and work experience as a Full-Stack Developer. The site is fully responsive, interactive, and designed with a modern, eye-catching UI.

## ✨ Features

This portfolio is a single-page application that includes:

* **Dynamic Hero Section:** A professional "welcome" section with an animated `TypeAnimation` component to display my roles (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer", "Node.js Expert").
* **Eye-Catching Visuals:** Features a custom circular image component with a soft, pulsing glow effect.
* **Interactive Skills Grid:** A "Skills & Technologies" section with filter buttons. Users can click "All," "Frontend," "Backend," etc., to see an animated grid of relevant technology icons.
* **Animated Experience Timeline:** A vertical timeline that showcases my professional work history, with cards that animate in on scroll.
* **Featured Projects Section:** A clean, alternating (left/right) layout to display my best projects, complete with descriptions, tech tags, and links.
* **WhatsApp Contact Form:** A modern contact form that captures the user's name, email, subject, and message, and then formats it into a pre-filled WhatsApp message by opening a `wa.me` link.
* **Responsive Design:** The entire site is built mobile-first and is fully responsive for all devices, from small phones to large desktops.
* **Consistent UI/Branding:** Uses a custom-defined dark theme based on the `rich_black`, `prussian_blue`, `cerulean`, and `picton_blue` color palette.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
